Indeed, the diagram illustrates that the \"Diverse\" category has a much higher average box office revenue compared to the \"Not Diverse\" category.

This can be interpreted as an indication that diversity can have a positive economic impact. Let's see how much by comparing average incomes."

    "The results of the OLS linear regression table indicate how each of the independent variables – diversity, vote_average and budget – influences films' box office revenues. Here is how they influence according to the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity :\n",
    "- Coefficient: 1.049e+07\n",
    "- P-Value: 0.001\n",
    "- Interpretation: The positive coefficient for diversity indicates that an increase in the diversity index by one unit is associated with an average increase in box office revenue of 10,490,000 monetary units, assuming all other variables remain constant. The p-value close to zero indicates that this relationship is statistically significant, meaning that the effect of diversity on box office revenue is likely not due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average vote rating :\n",
    "- Coefficient: 7.684e+06\n",
    "- P-Value: 0.000\n",
    "- Interpretation: The positive coefficient of the average voting score suggests that a one-point increase in the average rating is associated with an average increase in box office revenue of 7,684,000 monetary units, all else being equal. The extremely low p-value confirms the statistical significance of this variable, indicating that the relationship between average vote ratings and box office revenue is strongly supported by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Budget :\n",
    "- Coefficient: 2.3920\n",
    "- P-Value: 0.000\n",
    "- Interpretation: For budget, the coefficient of 2.3920 indicates that for each additional monetary unit invested in a film's budget, box office revenue increases by an average of 2.3920 monetary units. Again, the p-value indicates that this relationship is highly statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the results show that all three variables have a positive and significant influence on box office revenue. Specifically, films that are considered more diverse, have higher average voting scores, and have larger budgets tend to generate higher box office revenue. This can be interpreted as follows: diverse films may attract a larger or more engaged audience, films with high ratings may benefit from word of mouth and favorable reviews, and a higher budget may reflect higher quality production or greater marketing, which in turn can attract more viewers to the box office."

    "## Budget as Main Reason for Diversity in Movies\n",
    "Let's try to understand the reasons for diverse casting for a film. The first idea that we comes to mind when we seek to explain the diversity of a film. the budget because the budget can often determine the scope of actors a film project can attract. A diverse cast can also broaden the film's appeal to a wider audience, thereby increasing its earning potential at the international box office."

    "So, it is clear that diverse films generally have a higher budget than non-diverse films because they target a wider and international audience. This explains why producers invest more in these films to maximize their profitability. The main reason behind this strategy is to reach out to the global market. This is because diverse films can be more appealing to global audiences, meaning greater box office revenue potential. Producers are therefore willing to invest more to reach this expanded market. Let's see, statistically, if the trend where big budget films are more likely to be diversified compared to lower budget films holds true."

    "The difference in average budgets between diverse and non-diverse films is statistically significant.  The low P-value strongly rejects the null hypothesis, suggesting that casting diversity in films is indeed related to their budget. In practice, this may indicate that larger budget films tend to be more diverse than lower budget films. This analysis offers strong evidence supporting the idea that higher budgets are associated with greater casting diversity."
